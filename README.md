# **SAIVT Soft Biometric Database**

## **Overview**
The SAIVT-SoftBio database contains a collection of multi-camera sequences of 152 pedestrians captured from a set of 8 surveillance cameras. This database provides a challenging and realistic test-bed for person redetection tasks, and is freely available for download. Contact Dr Simon Denman (s dot denman at qut dot edu dot au) for more information.

## **Installing the SAIVT-SoftBio Database**
[Download and unzip this archive] (https://Q0102-RO:Vieyae3G@q0102-webdav.qcloud.qcif.edu.au/SAIVT-SoftBio.tar.gz)

At this point, you should have the following data structure and the SAIVT-SoftBio database is installed:
```

The 'Calibration' directory contains a camera calibration and background images (one image per camera) for the dataset. It is arranged into groups of subjects (i.e. C1--U1-17 contains camera calibration and background images valid for subjects 1 to 17). All camera calibration has been calculated using Tsai's method.
The 'Uncontrolled' directory contains the image sequences for each subject, arranged by camera view.

The 'SAIVTSoftBioDatabase.xml' file defines the database. This file specifies the number of cameras used and number of calibrations present, the regions of interest for each camera (<camera> tags), the location of the calibration information (<calibration> tags), and the subjects themselves (<uncontrolledsubject> tags). Note that for each subject, a camera calibration is specified.
